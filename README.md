Library Management System


To run the library management system website:
To use our website locally, you have to do the following things:
1.	Download XAMPP software for your device ( Windows or MacOS) through this link https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html
2.	After you have installed XAMPP on your device, start the software. 
3.	After it has successfully started, it will show us an IP address and then we can start ProFTPD, Apache, and MySQL.
4.	After everything is working, we need to have a secure port to host our website. So, start the SSH server over port 80 on the network tab and the system will be running.
5.	After you have completed starting XAMPP, to use the website we will need to add the library folder in the XAMPP source code files to open it.
6.	So, open Finder/XAMPP/htdocs and then paste the library folder here so that we can run it through a browser.
7.	The next step is to import the database for the website. So, to import the database, open a web browser and type localhost:8080/phpMyAdmin. This will take you to the site where we will store our database. Once the site is opened, click on databases, import and then upload the library_management_system.sql file to see the database.  
8.	The final step to use the website is to open a browser to run it. So, to run it on a browser open localhost:8080/library and it will take you to the homepage of the website. 
9.	To open the admin page of our website, go to phpMyAdmin and click on the users table of our database. It will then show you the admin email and password to log in as admin into the system. 
10.	In case you are not able to find the admin information,
 email: admin@admin.com 
 password: 123456
11.	To login as a student, you can click on the login page and enter your credentials, or you can register as a new user and create an account.
12.	If users want to borrow a book, they can click on the borrow book tab and search for all books or specific books to borrow.
13.	The users can also leave feedback and contact the library through the sidebar panel on the left side of the website.

Thank you and we hope you like it :)
