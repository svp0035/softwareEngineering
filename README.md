Library Management System


To run the library management system website:
1. Download XAMPP and install it
2. Open XAMPP/htdocs and copy the library folder and paste here
3. Run XAMPP and on a browser, open localhost:8080/phpmyadmin. After you open the mysql database click on databases and click on the import link. After you open the import, add the library_management_system.sql file to the database. 
4. After you have successfully done all these parts to run the website:
	localhost:8080/library
5. This will open the main page of our library and you can click on login or register to use the system.
6. To open the admin page, click on the users table of our database and it contains the admin email and password.
7. In case you can't find the admin information,
	email: admin@admin.com
	password: 1234556

Thank you and we hope you like it :)
